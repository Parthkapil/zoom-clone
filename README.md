# zoom-clone

This is a zoom clone made using the MERN stack. A user can start a meeting and other can join that meeting using a link shared by the host.
There are some bugs in the platform. For example, if more than 6 people join a chat room then the voice starts to break. I am working on that bug and hopefully it will be fixed soon :)
